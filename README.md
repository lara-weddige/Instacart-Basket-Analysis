# Instacart-Basket-Analysis
Analysis of Instacart customer purchasing habits to answer business questions and help create data-driven marketing strategies. 


# Objective
This analysis aimed to assist the marketing team in answering key business questions to understand their customers and discover new data-driven strategies to increase sales and create loyal customers. 


# Key questions answered
Some of the key business questions posed by the marketing team were:
1. Which are the busiest days of the week with the most orders?
2. Which times are the busiest?
3. When do customers spend the most money?
4. What price segmentation could be used to simplify grouping products?
5. Which products are most popular?
6. Which departments see the highest product order frequency?
7. How do customer ordering behaviors differ? I.e. who has high brand loyalty? Does customer brand loyalty influence ordering habits? Are there regional differences in ordering? Does age impact ordering habits? Does family status impact ordering habits? Is other demographic segmentation useful based on customer information? Do certain customer profiles show differences in terms of order price, order frequency, products ordered, or anything else?
